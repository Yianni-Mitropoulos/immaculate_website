        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            A very high-level language ("VHLL") is a programming language with a very high level of abstraction, especially in connection with memory management. Popular examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript. They're distinguished from what we'll call moderately high-level languages ("MHLL") like C, C++, Rust, and Zig which are designed to give the programmer near-unlimited control over the machine code that's ultimately produced. Such languages are almost always compiled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Immaculate is a VHLL language that's designed to address all of the biggest problems with that genre of language, both from the standpoint of the developer and from the standpoint of the end-user. The (admittedly ambitious) goal is to completely displace competing VHLL languages like Python, Java, and maybe even JavaScript. The strategy for achieving this outcome is simple: we use creativity, innovation, critical thinking and a health respect for the unifying principles of pure mathematics to create a programming language that address every single major issue with the competiton.

            <strong>Immaculate does not currently exist as software that can be used and downloaded.</strong> It's currently just a dream. This website was created to help attract talent to the project. With enough talent, this dream may well become a reality.
