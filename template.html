        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Immaculate is a very-high-level language (VHLL) that's designed to address the biggest issues with that genre of language, both from the standpoint of the developer and from the standpoint of the end-user. The long-term goal is to complete with and ultimately displace competing very-high-level languages like Python, Java, Go, and maybe even JavaScript. To achieve this goal, the broader strategy is to:
            <li> Attract talented thinkers. </li>
            <li> Display a healthy respect for the insights of pure mathematics. </li>
            <li> Do things at the right level of abstraction. </li>
            <li> Keep both the software developer and the end-user in mind at all times. </li>
            <li> Take our sweet time. </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>By taking our time, we can better leverage the creativity and critical thinking skills of our contributors, innovate effectively, develop appropriate abstractions, and avoid the numerous mistakes of numerous competing frameworks.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that Immaculate does not currently exist as software that can be used and downloaded; it's currently just a dream. This website was created to help attract the necessary talent to begin making that dream a reality.

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h2>Three-Pronged Design</h2>
        <p>
            According to the current plan, Immaculate is actually three different languages. Software developers write <strong>human-readable Immaculate</strong>. When ready, they transpile this into <strong>group-level Immaculate</strong>, replacing function names with Blake3 identifiers to ensure that anyone within the target group can automatically download the functionality they need via a recursive process, facilitating easy install and P2P sharing within that group. The computer of the end-user then transpiles this into a lower-level language called <strong>executable Immaculate</strong>, which replaces the Blake3 identifiers with more efficient nonhash identifiers, chooses concrete implementations for vaguely-defined functions like 'sort_list', and makes use of mutable design patterns that are not available in either of the other two versions of the language. The computer of the end-user then runs the program under question by JIT-compiling executable Immaculate as needed.
